    <h1>Case Study for myFlix App</h1>

<h2>OVERVIEW:</h2>
<p>
  myFlix is a movie app that is built from the ground up using the MERN tech stack. The app shows info about movies including: Title, directors, genres, and descriptions about the movies. Users can create an account and add or remove movies to their favorite movie list, and update or delete their profile.
</p>

<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>
<p>
  This project was part of CareerFoundry’s full-stack development course to show mastery in full-stack development.
</p>

<h2>OBJECTIVE:</h2>
<p>
  This project was made to bolster my portfolio. I wanted to build a complete server and client-side application from scratch.
</p>

<h2>THE PROJECT:</h2>

<h3>Server-Side:</h3>
<p>
  Using Node.js and Express, I created a RESTful API that interacts with a non-relational database with MongoDB. I used CRUD to make my methods let GET or PUT. Data can be retrieved from the database and is formatted in JSON. Postman helped me test my endpoints and I used HTTP authentication and JWT authorization.
</p>

<h3>Client-Side:</h3>
<p>
  I used React to develop the frontend of the application. The site is a SPA (single page application) so it uses different view components. Users can see info about a movie, the movie view, or see their profile, a profile view.
</p>

<h2>THE CHALLENGE:</h2>
<p>
  Building the API was interesting to build and was a fun step away from the frontend. It was challenging because I didn’t understand the full picture and how it was going to be used to interact with the frontend. I couldn’t wait to get into the client-side of the application. React opened my eyes to the ‘iceberg’ that is web development, and I was torn between wanting things to go back to the simpler, comfortable way and diving deeper to learn more tools to bring my applications to the next level.
</p>

<h2>DURATION:</h2>
<p>
  This project took me a long time to finish, and it was complex and hard to learn. Once I saw how everything fit together and realized what I had accomplished my confidence soared. I knew that this project did not need to drag on as long as it needed to. I don’t have to be afraid of uncharted ground.
